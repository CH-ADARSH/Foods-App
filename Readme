## Coding Assignment:

- Build a `Food Ordering App`
  - Think of a `cool name` for your app
  - Build an `AppLayout`
  - Build a `Header Component` with Logo & Nav Items & Cart
  - Build a `Body Component`
    - Build `RestaurantList Component`
    - Build `RestaurantCard Component`
      - Use `static data initially`
      - Make your `card dynamic`(pass in props)
        - `Props` - passing arguments to a function - Use Destructuring & Spread operator
      - `Render` your cards with dynamic data of restaurants
      - Use `Array.map` to render all the restaurants

## Coding Challenge

- Understood the importance of the file structure.
  - Every Component should be in a different file name after its component_name.(Always make sure Components must start with capital letterðŸš€).
  - It is a good practice to keep the HARD-CODED DATA(EG:- data,logoimg,cdn for images if any) in utils folder in the src.
  - This is considered a good practice.
- Learnt about 2 different types of imports and exports named export and other is default export.
  - Suppose you want to export 2 values its better to use named export.(simply by writing "export const Utils_Name").
  - Else use default export for componets.
  - Named export can be imported using following eg:-
    import {named export name} from "../utils/named export name".
  - you can use a default export along with named exports in the same JavaScript/React file
